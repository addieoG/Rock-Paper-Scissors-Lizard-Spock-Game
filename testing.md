## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I manually tested in the following ways:-

1. Using live server, an extension in VS Code, I manually checked, viewed the code live. I also used other tools such a Dev tools to check for responsiveness. 
    
2. After publishing the page on Github, I shared with a few a friends to test and share their feedback.


### ***Manual Testing:***
* To test for cross browers compatability I used three browers, two desktop and one mobile.

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Samsung Mobile

* Using devtools, I set the responsiveness of the page from 320px to 4000px  to simulate different screen sizes. 
* I also checked on my own mobile device and asked friends and collegues to do the same on theirs. 

### ***Bugs and Fixes:***

To help identify the bugs throughout this project, I used the VS Code extension to mannualy test throughout. Below is a list of some of the bugs and solutions to same that I came across.
