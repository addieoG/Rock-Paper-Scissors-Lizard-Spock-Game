## **Site Overview**
This site is my first real introduction to world of javascript in the form a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock game. The site, inspired by 80's, 90's retro gaming has a very simple flow and design to it. It opens with on a landing page, allowing the user to have their first interaction. On this page, they can read about rules of the game and more importantly how to enter and play. Once they decide to enter, they will be alerted by pop up, reminding them to choose their difficulty level (to which there are three settings) to commence the game. On the game page, once the user has selected their difficulty preference the game will commence. The user will select form a choice of 5 inputs, the computer will simultaneously select their choice through the beautiful form of logic. The game will then map each users choice, decide who won the round, track the score and ultimatly decide who won the game through another alert. This alert will also inform the user who to restart the game. There is also an exit button, in the form of a rules button that will direct the user back to the main page. The header holds a simple text displaying the name of the game while the footer holds an anchor tag, directing ths user to follow on the creaters github page.
